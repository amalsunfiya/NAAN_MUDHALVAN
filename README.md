# MACHINE_TRANSLATION_PROJECT
## Overview

This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree. It focuses on building a deep neural network for English-to-French machine translation. The end-to-end pipeline takes English text as input and generates the corresponding French translation.

## Key Steps

* Text preprocessing and tokenization
* Converting text data into sequences of integers
* Building and training neural network models
* Generating translations using the trained model

## Models

Different neural network architectures are implemented and evaluated to identify the most effective model for translation.

## Prediction

The trained model is used to translate new English sentences into French.

## Files Included

* helper.py
* machine_translation.ipynb
* machine_translation.html

## Submission Process

* Review project requirements
* Generate the HTML version of the notebook using nbconvert
* Submit the notebook, HTML file, and helper script as a zip file

## Optional Enhancement

Train-test data splitting can be applied using train_test_split to obtain a more realistic evaluation of model performance.
